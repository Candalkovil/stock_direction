# Stock Market Trend Forecasting using LSTM Networks
Introduction:
This project aims to predict the stock market trends for Apple Inc. using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a special kind of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The model utilizes historical stock data to forecast whether the stock price will go up or down on the next trading day.

# Key Features:
1. Data Collection: Used yfinance to fetch historical stock data for Apple Inc.
2. Data Processing: Incorporated technical indicators such as RSI and rolling averages to engineer features for the prediction model.
3. Modeling: Implemented an LSTM-based neural network using TensorFlow and Keras.
4. Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance on a held-out test set and highlighted key metrics.
5. Forecast: The model predicts the trend for the next trading day based on the most recent data.
   
# Setup and Usage:
## Requirements:
Python 3.x  
TensorFlow 2.x  
yfinance  
pandas  
numpy  
scikit-learn  

# Installation:
bash  
Copy code  
pip install -r requirements.txt  

# Usage:
bash  
Copy code  
python stock_prediction.py  

# Results:
Achieved an accuracy of X% in predicting the stock market trend for the next trading day.  

# Challenges:
1. Data Imbalance: Addressing the issue of data imbalance where one class (UP/DOWN) might have significantly more samples than the other.
2. Feature Engineering: Determining which technical indicators to use and how to incorporate them for better model performance.
3. Hyperparameter Tuning: Experimenting with various hyperparameters for the LSTM model to optimize its performance.
4. Future Improvements:
5. Incorporate more technical indicators.
6. Use ensemble methods or stacking with other models.
7. Explore transfer learning by utilizing pre-trained models on large financial datasets.
