Stock Market Trend Forecasting using LSTM Networks
Introduction:
This project aims to predict the stock market trends for Apple Inc. using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a special kind of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The model utilizes historical stock data to forecast whether the stock price will go up or down on the next trading day.

Key Features:
Data Collection: Used yfinance to fetch historical stock data for Apple Inc.
Data Processing: Incorporated technical indicators such as RSI and rolling averages to engineer features for the prediction model.
Modeling: Implemented an LSTM-based neural network using TensorFlow and Keras.
Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance on a held-out test set and highlighted key metrics.
Forecast: The model predicts the trend for the next trading day based on the most recent data.
Setup and Usage:
Requirements:
Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
yfinance
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
Installation:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage:
bash
Copy code
python stock_prediction.py
Results:
Achieved an accuracy of X% in predicting the stock market trend for the next trading day.

Challenges:
Data Imbalance: Addressing the issue of data imbalance where one class (UP/DOWN) might have significantly more samples than the other.
Feature Engineering: Determining which technical indicators to use and how to incorporate them for better model performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experimenting with various hyperparameters for the LSTM model to optimize its performance.
Future Improvements:
Incorporate more technical indicators.
Use ensemble methods or stacking with other models.
Explore transfer learning by utilizing pre-trained models on large financial datasets.
